# Face Clustering & Tagging System

This project allows you to process group photos, extract faces, cluster similar faces, and tag them efficiently using both context-aware and cluster-aware interfaces.

## ðŸ”§ Components

### 1. **Face Extraction & Embedding**
Run this to:
- Detect all faces in `test_images/`
- Save cropped faces and overlays to `detected_faces/`
- Generate metadata and vector embeddings

```bash
python encode_faces_insightface.py test_images/
```

### 2. **Clustering by Similarity**
Groups faces across all images based on visual similarity:

```bash
python cluster_embeddings.py
```

### 3. **Cluster Tagging UI**
Visit:
```text
http://localhost:5001/cluster_tagging_ui.html
```

- Tag all faces in a cluster at once
- Mark as `Unknown` if unsure
- "Retag Unknowns" button helps revisit later
- Save and clean UI options available

### 4. **Contextual Image Tagging UI**
Visit:
```text
http://localhost:5001/
```

- View and tag each face in the context of the original group photo
- Auto-suggested tags from clusters and previous tags
- Keyboard shortcuts, filtering, and suggestions built-in

### 5. **Clean-up & Reclustering**
To remove deleted or irrelevant entries and regenerate clusters:
```bash
python cleanup_and_recluster.py
```
